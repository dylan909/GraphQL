# GraphQL
Learning GraphQL

I will be following the [How to graphQL tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/).

Its broken down into lessons so after i complete one i write up a summary of what i learned and include it on here.

## GraphQL fundamentals

### Introduction

**What is GraphQL** 

- GraphQL is a new API standard that was created and open sourced by facebook.
- Its a more considereds more efficent and powerful alternative to the [rest API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api)
- Enables declarative data fetching, meaning you can ask for what you want when querying
- GraphQL server exposes a single endpoint and responds to queries, responds with exactly the data you want.

**How does it work?**

- Most app's have the need to fetch data that's stored remotely in a database, that's accessible over the internet. 
- This is what servers are used for. When a client needs something from the database. it will make a request to the server. 
- The server then queries the database for the info and send's it back to the client.

### GraphQl is the better alternative to rest 

**GraphQL vs REST**

- REST is good as it offers stateless servers and structured access to resources.
- REST API's are flexible enough for modern day web app's
- GraphQL was created to cope with the need of more flexiblity and effiency in client-side communication.
- no over/under fetching

### GraphQL core concepts

**The Schema Definition Language (SDL)**

The SDL is a way of writing the type of data the client should expect from the API. 

```
type Person{
  name: String!
  age: Int!
```
```
type Post{
  title: String!
```
Here we're define two different types. 

The person type has two fields name, which expecting a string type and age which is expecting an interger type. The ! means this is required.

The type Post is expecting a title which is a type string. 

We can define a relation very easily
```
type Person{
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  posts: [Post!]!
```
```
type Post{
  title: String!
  author: Person!
```
Now everytime we make a post we need to include a person who is an author of it and a person can write multiple posts as Post is surronded by brackets meaning its a list type. This would be a one to many relationship.

**Fetching data with queries**

We create queries to get the data back from the server. This is done drastically different from REST API's

```
{
  allPersons {   //this is called the rootfield
    name     //everything that follows the rootfield is called the payload
    age
  }
}
```
This particular quiry is going to bring back a list of all the names and ages stored in the database. As seen below
```
{
  "allPersons": [
    { "name": "dylan", "age": 20 },
    { "name": "dylan", "age": 20},
    { "name": "dylan", "age": 20}
  ]
}
```
In a graphQL query each field can have one or more arguments if that is specified in the GraphQL schema.

```
{
  allPersons(last: 2) {   
    name    
    age
  }
}
```

For example allPersons could have a last parameter to reposond with the last two persons in the database.

A nice feature graphQL have is allowing nested querying. 

```
{
  allPersons {   
    name    
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
As seen above you can include a posts query that will return the posts that a person has and you just have to follow the structure of your types to req.

**Writing data with mutations**

You sometimes need to make changes to the database. this is done in graphql with mutations.

There are three types of mutations:
1. creating new data
2. updating exisiting data
3. deleting existing data

Generally mutations follow the same syntactical structure as queries, however you always need to start with the mutation keyword.

```
mutation{
  createPerson(name: "bob", age: 36){ //here the rootfield is createperson, also it has arguments for field
    name // We still use payload
    age
  }
}
```
The server will respond with the following if successful. It's shaped the same way as the mutation was sent

```
{
  "createPerson": {
    "name": "bob",
    "age": 21,
  }
}
```
One thing to observe is graphql types have unique id's created by the server. We could create a mutation like this and include id in the payload.
```
mutation{
  createPerson(name: "bob", age: 36){ //here the rootfield is createperson, also it has arguments for field
    id
  }
}
```
When the person is created you now have the id of that person back. You can use this for future requests.

**Realtime updates with subscriptions**

When a client subscribes to an event it will initate and hold a steady connection to the server.

```
subscription {
  newPerson {
    name
    age
  }
}
```
In this subscription everytime a new user is created it sends that data to the client

Say there was 2 new users created.

```
{
  "newperson": {
    "name": "bob",
    "age": 21
  }
}
```
```
{
  "newperson": {
    "name": "pieter",
    "age": 22
  }
}
```
The server would then send the corresponding data to the subscribed data.


**THE GRAPHQL SCHEMA**

Now we have a basic understanding of queries, mutation, the SDL and subscriptions. We can put them together to create the schema.

- defines what the API can do by specifying how a client fetch and update data
- represents contract between server and client.
- collection of gQL types with special root types.

A schema is a collection of gQL types. However when writing a schema for an API, there are special root types.

Root types
```
type Query {
 ...
}

type Mutation{

}

type Subscription {

}
```
These types are entry points for the requests send by the client. To enable the allPersons-query that we saw before, the Query type would have to be written as follows:

'''
type Query {
  allPersons: [Person!]!
}
'''

All persons is the root field of the API. Here's another example using the last parameter we had before.



```
type Query {
  allPersons(last: Int): [Person!]!
}
```



Similarly for the createPerson mutation we have to create the root type mutation

```
type Mutation {
  createPerson(name: String!, age: Int!): Person!
}
```


Finally, for the subscriptions, weâ€™d have to add the newPerson root field:

```
type Subscription {
  newPerson: Person!
}
```

Here is all the full schema for all queries and mutations from this lesson

```
type Query {
  allPersons(last: Int): [Person!]!
  allPosts(last: Int): [Post!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createPerson(name: String!, age: Int!): Person!
  updatePerson(id: ID!, name: String!, age: String!): Person!
  deletePerson(id: ID!): Person!
}

type Subscription {
  newPerson: Person!
}

type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  title: String!
  author: Person!
}
```

### Big picture architecture

**Use cases**

In this section we will be walked through 3 different architectures that includes a grapgQL server.

1. graphql server with connected DB
2. GraphQL server that is a thin layer in front of a number of third party or legacy systems and integrates them through a single GraphQL API
3. A hybrid approach of a connected database and third party or legacy systems that can all be accessed through the same GraphQL API


**graphql server with connected DB**

This architecture will be the most common for greenfield projects. In the setup, you have a single (web) server that implements the GraphQL specification. When a query arrives at the GraphQL server, the server reads the queryâ€™s payload and fetches the required information from the database. This is called resolving the query. It then constructs the response object as described in the official specification and returns it to the client.

Itâ€™s important to note that GraphQL is actually transport-layer agnostic. This means it can potentially be used with any available network protocol. So, it is potentially possible to implement a GraphQL server based on TCP, WebSockets, etc.

GraphQL also doesnâ€™t care about the database or the format that is used to store the data. You could use a SQL database like AWS Aurora or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.


**Resolver Functions**

As you learned in the previous chapter, the payload of a GraphQL query (or mutation) consists of a set of fields. In the GraphQL server implementation, each of these fields actually corresponds to exactly one function thatâ€™s called a resolver. The sole purpose of a resolver function is to fetch the data for its field.

When the server receives a query, it will call all the functions for the fields that are specified in the queryâ€™s payload. It thus resolves the query and is able to retrieve the correct data for each field. Once all resolvers returned, the server will package data up in the format that was described by the query and send it back to the client.
